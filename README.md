# Overview

Code for the paper **An effective negative sampling approach for contrastive learning of sentence embedding**. We proposed an effective method (nmCSE) to sample informative negative partners to enhance the performance of contrastive learning. The repository contains the code of our method, which is implemented based on [SimCSE](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SimCSE).
